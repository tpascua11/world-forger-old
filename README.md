# draco-forge-rpg
This is my old project attempting to make rpg maker but more universal.
The thing I wanted is when I make simple games is to create entities in the game faster, like items, characters, classes, and stuff.
The new project is at https://github.com/tpascua11/Entity-Master, I didn't realize for awhile that the vuejs version was old for awhile.
